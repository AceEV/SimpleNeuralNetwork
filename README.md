# SimpleNeuralNetwork

This is my first attempt at getting into the world of ML/AI.

I strongly believe that this is one of the best 1st examples of a Neural Network one can work on to get a strong hold on the basics.

This code was made referncing the idea from [Daniel Shiffman's videos on Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7MdSCaIfsxc561QI0U0Tb) and my shot at re-creating the basics in Python, instead of JavaScript, which he preferred to work with.

This is a Simple Neural Network with 1 Input Layer, 1 Hidden Layer and 1 Output Layer.
This neural network learns to output the XOR of the given inputs.

The XOR operations returns a true(1) if the input contains odd number of 1s else false(0).

The concept is a basic Feedforward algorithm followed by Backpropagation using Gradient Decent.
